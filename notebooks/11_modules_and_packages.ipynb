    "If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a text editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known as creating a **script**. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying its definition into each script.\n",
    "\n",
    "To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an interactive instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a **module**; definitions from a module can be imported into other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script executed at the top level and in calculator mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix *.py* appended. Within a module, the module’s name (as a string) is available as the value of the global variable `__name__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So say we write a python module and save it as a *.py* file. How do we use it? Well, we first have to import it (like the way we were importing packages all along!)."
